# Aura Sense - Gender and Mood Recognizer System

## Introduction

**Aura Sense** is a real-time system designed to detect **gender** and **emotions** from image data. This project leverages deep learning techniques to provide insights into the identity and mood of users, enabling personalized and context-aware interactions.

The system is ideal for applications in:
- Virtual assistants
- Healthcare systems
- Customer service
- Security and surveillance

By combining gender recognition with mood detection, the project enhances user interactions through intelligent and empathetic responses.

## Features

- **Gender Recognition**: Predicts gender (Male/Female) using image and video inputs.
- **Mood Detection**: Identifies emotional states (e.g., Angry, Happy, Sad, etc.) from facial expressions.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Handles live inputs for immediate predictions.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Can be integrated into a variety of platforms, including healthcare, customer service, and security.

## Project Goals

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**:
   - Labeled datasets for male and female voices and image features (facial landmarks).
   - Feature extraction using pitch, MFCC, and formants for grayscale resizing for images.

2. **Model Development & Training**:
   - Classifier models (CNN, neural networks) for gender and mood recognition.
   - Performance optimization using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

3. **Mood Recognition (Extension)**:
   - Research and implement mood recognition features like prosody and pitch variation.
   - Integrate and test mood classification capabilities.

4. **Final Deliverable**:
   - A complete real-time system for gender detection and mood detection, with demo capabilities and well-documented code.

## Dataset

### Training Dataset
- 7 Emotion Classes: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprise
- Gender Classes: Male, Female

### Validation/Test Dataset
- Includes all 7 emotion classes and 2 gender classes.
- The dataset is organized into subfolders by class for easy preprocessing with Keras.
